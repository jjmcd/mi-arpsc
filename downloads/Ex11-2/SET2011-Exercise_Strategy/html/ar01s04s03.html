			In previous exercises, nets were often micromanaged by the STM, specifying meeting times, frequencies, etc. This worked better than giving vague instructions to the net manager with the expectation that they would "deal with it", but in the event of an actual incident, is quite unrealstic.

			If they are to be at all useful in an actual event, the nets must understand their responsibilities, and net managers must develop strategies for activating their net at unusual times and/or frequencies. By assigning Districts to nets more or less permanently, the nets have a better defined scope, and a "customer" with whom they may develop a relationship.
		</div><div class="para">
			For the coming SET (and hopefully future exercises and incidents), it is expected that each Net Manager will contact the corresponding District Emergency Coordinator and arrange net schedules, frequencies, net controls and liaisons. Note that all nets should expect to send a liaison to the SEOC early in the event, but other times need to be worked out between the net and the District.
		</div><div class="para">
			Since exercises typically last only a few hours, a net may choose to meet for the duration of the event, or may elect to schedule specific times of contact so that the counties have targeted times for which to prepare traffic. While most nets may choose to meet on their normal frequencies, note that the SEOC will be occupying the GLETN and QMN frequencies, which happen to be the Michigan phone and CW emergency frequencies, so these nets will need to select alternate frequences.
