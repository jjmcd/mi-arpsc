			The Section also organizes statewide exercises each year. Section exercises, unlike State-sponsored exercises, tend to be functional, exercising primarily communications skills, and are developed to attempt to engage all the counties within the state.
		</div><div class="para">
			The Section has continued to work on the ARES/NTS interface and held two drills in 2011 to develop that skill. A Section-wide exercise was held in conjunction with the State's New Madrid Aftermath exercise, and the annual SET was also used to develop that skill.
		</div><div class="para">
			In addition, also in conjunction with NMA, A drill was held with the State of Indiana to exercise sending a specific form between state EOCs. Only a relatively few stations participated in that drill, which also involved Michigan Army MARS and Indiana Navy MARS.
		</div><div class="para">
			One objective for 2011 was to make better use of FEMA's HSEEP for exercises. The Indiana drill moved us quite far in that direction, and the October SET followed the FEMA procedures quite closely.
