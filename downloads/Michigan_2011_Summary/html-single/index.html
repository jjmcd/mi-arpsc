		The Michigan Amateur Radio Public Service Corps (ARPSC) is an organization of over 2,000 amateur radio operators who participate in public service and emergency response activities. These include such things as providing communications for various walks and runs, as well as reporting storm damage, participating in search and rescue efforts, and providing backup communications for public safety officers.
	</div><div class="para">
		There are two primary programs, the Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) and the National Traffic System (NTS). ARES provides "feet on the ground" for various events and incidents, while NTS provides a communications infrastructure that moves formal messages across the state and across the nation.
	</div><div class="para">
		There are two other programs, associated with ARES, which do not report independently. These are RACES and SKYWARN. RACES consists of those ARES members who have been approved by their local government to operate in critical areas such as incident scenes or Emergency Operations Centers. This approval generally requires a degree of training and a background check. The Michigan Section and the Michigan State Police have published suggested RACES qualifications, but the responsibility for vetting RACES members rests with the local Emergency Management Coordinator. Most counties follow the guidelines closely.
	</div><div class="para">
		SKYWARN members provide ground weather observations to their local jurisdictions and to the National Weather Service. SKYWARN members do not have to be ARES members, but almost always are, and most counties run SKYWARN programs as part of their ARES programs. SKYWARN observers are trained by the National Weather Service.
	</div><div class="para">
		Together, Michigan amateurs reported over 138,000 volunteer hours during 2011 representing a contribution of almost $3 million <sup>[<a id="id804061" href="#ftn.id804061" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>. This is up substantially over 2010 (88,368 hours).

		ARES represents the largest program. ARES has a program in each Michigan county, managed by an Emergency Coordinator who works closely with the Emergency Management Director of the county to provide backup communications to the local jurisdiction.
	</div><div class="para">
		Because Michigan counties are so varied, the ARES organizations within those counties are quite varied. Although their primary customer is typically the county Emergency Management organization, they may also work with the local Red Cross, Salvation Army, and other NGOs. In some counties, the liaison with the fire departments or Sheriff's office is especially close. Each county has different needs, and the ARES organization attempts to meet those needs.
	</div><div class="para">
		In Michigan, and especially southern Michigan, severe weather is common, and in many cases, the greatest effort is expended with weather related activities. Amateurs spot bad weather and report to their National Weather Service office when bad weather is approaching, and following severe weather, are often involved in recovery operations.
	</div><div class="para">
		Late spring and early summer tend to be the time when damaging weather is encountered, and this is also the time that many organizations hold runs, walks and other events for which amateurs frequently provide communications. Hence, the peak in the middle of the year in the graph below:

			The Michigan State Police divides the state into 7 Districts, and appoints a District Coordinator for each. ARES has a District Emergency Coordinator for each of those districts, who works with the District coordinator. In addition, the Section appoints a District Emergency Coordinator for each of the National Weather Service offices in the state. This NWS DEC works with the office's Warning Coordination Meteorologist to provide training to SKYWARN members and implement circuits that permit field observations to be transmitted to the NWS office effectively.

		Michigan's National Traffic System consists of amateurs who send messages (called "traffic") around the Section and around the nation. These amateurs are organized into a group of on the air nets that meet frequently with the intent of passing messages. These are the "unsung heros" of ARPSC; many practice their skills every day, but they operate behind the scenes, out of the eye of the served agencies and the public.
	</div><div class="para">
		The individual nets report monthly. Michigan nets send approximately 1000 messages a month. In 2011, they reported 17,053 messages passed. Not all traffic is reported, although the large number of non-reporting nets probably pass a small fraction of the messages. The chart below shows the performance across the year:

	</div><div class="para">
		Michigan amateurs also participate in other nets. The Eighth Region net takes messages destined for out of state addresses, and collects traffic bound for Michigan to pass to Michigan representatives who will then carry those messages to the Michigan nets. The Eastern Area Net interfaces with the Region nets to move traffic among the Regions in the Eastern Area. The Transcontinental Corps arranges to move traffic between the Areas. Michigan amateurs participate in all of these, however that effort is not reflected in Michigan reporting.

			Since most of the traffic is handled by relatively few stations, and those stations tend to be the stations that report, the traffic totals reported are quite high. Stations handling a lot of traffic tend to be those stations that act as liaisons to Region or Area nets, so even though the number of stations reporting is quite small, the amount of traffic reported is considerably larger than the totals from net reports, which include only messages passed on Michigan nets.

			ARES hours across the emergency and public service categories are relatively flat. As might be expected, emergency hours tend to be higher in bad weather years. It is interesting that public service hours tend to track emergency hours; perhaps indicating that active years also lead to more reporting.
		</div><div class="para">
			Active years also tend to show an increase in drills. Not only do active years encourage interest, but bad weather damages amateur radio infrastructure as well, and programs tend to hold drills to test newly repaired or installed equipment.

		</div><div class="para">
			The drop for 2011 is probably somewhat permanent. The Wolverine Net had been an NTS affiliated traffic net. Over the years the traffic has dwindled, and last year that net asked to drop its affiliation with NTS, and along with it, their reporting. In addition, the Northern Lower Eastern Upper Peninsula net has been without leadership, and hence, without reporting.
