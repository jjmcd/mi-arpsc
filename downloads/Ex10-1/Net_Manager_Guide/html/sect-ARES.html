			 ARES is the "feet on the ground" side of ARPSC. NTS is the behind the scenes engine that moves messages. Because it is largely involved in local response, ARES is not often visible to NTS operators. However, in the Michigan Section we have approxmately 2,000 ARES members. It is a large, highly structured organization which works closely with the Michigan State Police, local emergency management, and many other public service and public safety organizations.

			ARES is organized along the State Police Districts. There are 11 District Emergency Coordinators reporting to the Section Emergency Coordinator. These DECs represent the seven State Police Districts and the four National Weather Service offices in Michigan.
		</div><div class="para">
			Each of Michigan's 83 counties has an Emergency Coordinator who reports to the respective District Emergency Coordinator. These ECs and DECs often have assistants with specific responsibilities. SKYWARN is often closely associated with ARES, and many Assistant Emergency Coordinators serve as their county's SKYWARN coordinator.
		</div><div class="para">
			Each county has a local organization whose size and responsibilities vary widely depending on the size and needs of the county. In some rural counties the organization may consist of only two or three members, while a larger county may boast hundreds of members.
		</div><div class="para">
			At each level, ARES officials are aligned with government officials, and often work closely with them. The SEC works closely with the State Police Logistics Section Chief, the DECs work with MSP's District Coordinators, and the county ECs align with their individual county Emergency Manager. Whenever possible, the appointments are made jointly between the Section Manager and the appropriate government official. DECs serving NWS offices are aligned with that office's Warning Coordination Meterologist.
