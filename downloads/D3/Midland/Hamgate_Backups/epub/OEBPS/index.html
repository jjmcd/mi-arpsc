			Midland ARPSC maintains <code class="filename">hamgate.midland.ampr.org</code>, a gateway between local RF packet traffic and the remainder of the global packet network. The hamgate operates unattended in the penthouse of the Mid-Michigan Regional Medical Center. Almost all operation of the hamgate occurs remotely.
		</div><div class="para">
			Because the hamgate operates as infrastructure, it requires relatively little attention. One issue this causes is that few people are familiar with the internal operation of the hamgate. Because of this it is important that the hamgate be fully backed up in a transparent fashion, that these backups are kept in an easily useable format, and that a number of people have access to these backups.
