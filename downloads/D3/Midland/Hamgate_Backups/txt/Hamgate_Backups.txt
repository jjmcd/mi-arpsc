1. Introduction
---------------

Midland ARPSC maintains hamgate.midland.ampr.org, a gateway between local
RF packet traffic and the remainder of the global packet network. The
hamgate operates unattended in the penthouse of the Mid-Michigan Regional
Medical Center. Almost all operation of the hamgate occurs remotely.
Because the hamgate operates as infrastructure, it requires relatively
little attention. One issue this causes is that few people are familiar
with the internal operation of the hamgate. Because of this it is
important that the hamgate be fully backed up in a transparent fashion,
that these backups are kept in an easily useable format, and that a
number of people have access to these backups.


2. Overview of the Backup Process
---------------------------------

On a schedule determined by the Appendix A, crontab, gzipped tar files
are created for backup. These files are created locally, and then
retrieved from the hamgate by a remote system. Configuration of the
hamgate does not change frequently. However, it is useful to have
reasonably frequent full backups in case some change was made that wasn't
manually backed up. The backups are executed as follows:

  *  Each night the messages on the hamgate are backed up (refer to
    Appendix D, /root/JNOSmailBackup2).

  *  Every Monday, the entire /jnos directory tree is backed up (refer to
    Appendix C, /root/JNOSbackup). This directory tree includes all the
    configuration, data and programs specific to JNOS. This backup should
    allow for restoration of JNOS operation onto an existing Linux
    system.

  *  On the fourth of every month, the entire system is backed up (refer
    to Appendix B, /root/SystemBackup). This backup should allow for
    restoration of the entire system onto a blank system.

After the savesets have been created on the hangate, a cron job runs on a
server at WB8RCR (refer to Appendix E, Server crontab for the relevant
fragment of that crontab). Other systems with the appropriate SSH keys
could (and probably should) retrieve those tar files.


3. Disposition of the backups
-----------------------------

The backups collect at WB8RCR and are not automatically purged.
Periodically, some are deleted manually and others saved to optical
media. As a minimum, all message files, several JNOS backups and two full
backups are preserved on optical media for each year. In addition, a DVD
containing at least one full backup and all the message backups is
created on occasion and sent to either W8LSS or WB8FYR.
