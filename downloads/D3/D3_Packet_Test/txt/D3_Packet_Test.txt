1. Introduction
---------------

On January 28, 2012, the Third District of the Michigan Amateur Radio
Public Service Corps held a district-wide test of VHF packet. W8KEA is a
high profile packet BBS located atop the Mid-Michigan Regional Medical
Center. This is near the center of the District, and from that vantage
point, the station can hear much of the traffic in the District. This
document summarizes the packet traffic observed at W8KEA.


2. Stations observed at W8KEA
-----------------------------

During the course of the exercise, which ran for two hours in the
morning, thirty-nine unique SSIDs were observed transmitting packets. The
table below lists the stations heard and the number of packets heard from
each SSID during the two-hour period. Note that not all the stations in
the table were participating in the test, but may have simply had
digipeaters on the air during the test.

3. Traffic volume at W8KEA
--------------------------

During the course of the test, traffic built as more stations came on the
air. By approximately 10:30 AM traffic leveled off, and held more or less
constant until the end of the test when most stations secured. During the
course of the drill, approximately 4000 packets were received at W8KEA.

4. Individual Station Rates
---------------------------

Individual stations had widely varying profiles. Some stations started
late, others finished early. Most stations saw peak traffic toward the
middle of the exercise. A surprising number peaked toward the end of the
drill when many stations had secured.
