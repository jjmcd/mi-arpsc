ChapterÂ 1.Â Executive Summary
------------------------------

1.1. Major Strengths

1.2. Primary areas for improvement

The Indiana and Michigan Sections Earthquake Functional Drill
"Indiana-Michigan Digital Test" was developed to test Indiana and
Michigan Sections' ComC 3.4, ComC 5.2 and ComC 5.4. The exercise planning
team was composed of numerous and diverse agencies, including Indiana and
Michigan ARES, Army and Navy MARS, Indiana Department of Homeland
Security, the Michigan State Police Homeland Security and Emergency
Management Division, and Indiana and Michigan NTS. The exercise planning
team discussed modes to be used, communications relays anticipated, and
formatting messages for transmission. In the course of discussing the
exercise, it was discovered that the traffic which would likely be
transmitted between SEOCs was quite different than the types of traffic
practiced daily. Based on the exercise planning team's deliberations, the
following objectives were developed for Indiana-Michigan Digital Test:

  *  Objective 1: Organize a relatively complex drill across
    jurisdictions

  *  Objective 2: Transmit an EMAC ReqA request from the Indiana SEOC to
    the Michigan SEOC, formulate a response (ReqA Part II) in Michigan
    and return it to the Indiana SEOC the Michigan SEOC

The purpose of this report is to analyze exercise results, identify
strengths to be maintained and built upon, identify potential areas for
further improvement, and support development of corrective actions. The
April 9 drill was intended to be a dry run for a more complete test
during the New Madrid National Level Exercise (New Madrid Aftermath in
Michigan), but real-world issues prevented the planned May 17 test from
taking place.


1.1.Â Major Strengths
---------------------

The major strengths identified during this exercise are as follows:

  *  The six agencies, two governmental and four volunteer, were able to
    work together effectively.

  *  Creative solutions were developed by multiple parties when faced
    with unforseen difficulties.

  *  In spite of significant, unanticipated issues, the messages were
    able to be delivered, although the mechanisms were not what had been
    intended.


1.2.Â Primary areas for improvement
-----------------------------------

Throughout the exercise, several opportunities for improvement in amateur
radio's ability to respond to the incident were identified. The primary
areas for improvement, including recommendations, are as follows:

  *  The transmission modes selected turned out to be less than ideal for
    the traffic to be passed. Experimentation with other modes to outline
    the limitations should follow this test.

  *  Inconsistency between various "hubs" added unforseen complexity to
    Pactor operations when faced with challenging conditions. Either
    other, more straightforward, modes should be selected for emergency
    communications, or better training and/or documentation provided.

  *  Only a single type of document was tested. The jurisdictions, and
    probably other nearby jurisdictions, should develop procedures
    applicable to a wide range of messages of the type expected in the
    event of an incident.

3.1. Exercise Purpose and Design

3.2. Exercise Objectives, Capabilities, and Activities

3.3. Scenario Summary


3.1.Â Exercise Purpose and Design
---------------------------------

FEMA planned a "National Level Exercise" around a large earthquake event
in the central United States. The Sections had conducted a number of
small drills with neighboring states, but the planned NLE presented a
realistic scenario in which amateur radio might be required to provide
communications between State EOCs. In discussions with the Indiana
Department of Homeland Security it was determined that a probable SEOC to
SEOC message would be an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC)
request, prepared on a form called a "Req-A". This form is quite long,
and unlike the kinds of traffic practiced regularly by the National
Traffic System (NTS). The longer message would better be handled by
digital means. The National Traffic System maintains a digital
infrastructure, NTSD, which transmits messages using an email-like
protocol over radio. It was decided to use this mechanism, even though
NTSD-capable stations are small in number. Since MARS maintains a similar
infrastructure, a decision was made to attempt the same traffic over both
NTSD and MARS circuits. Although MARS participated in the exercise, this
document focuses on ARPSC results. MARS processes and structure is
somewhat different, as are the available modes and frequencies. It is
expected that MARS will also produce an after action report based around
their organization and processes.


3.2.Â Exercise Objectives, Capabilities, and Activities
-------------------------------------------------------

Capabilities-based planning allows for exercise planning teams to develop
exercise objectives and observe exercise outcomes through a framework of
specific action items that were derived from the Target Capabilities List
(TCL). The capabilities listed below form the foundation for the
organization of all objectives and observations in this exercise.
Additionally, each capability is linked to several corresponding
activities and tasks to provide additional detail. Based upon the
identified exercise objectives below, the exercise planning team has
decided to demonstrate the following capabilities during this exercise:

  *  Objective 1: Organize a relatively complex drill across
    jurisdictions

      *  Capability 1 Title: ComC 5.4 - Coordinate communications policy
        and procedure across response entities

          *  Activity 1.1 Initiate contact between sections

          *  Activity 1.2 Agree on outline of exercise

          *  Activity 1.3 Recruit necessary resources

          *  Activity 1.4 Recruit liaisons with government organizations

          *  Activity 1.5 Develop exercise plan

          *  Activity 1.6 Develop communications protocols

          *  Activity 1.7 Execute exercise

  *  Objective 2: Transmit an EMAC ReqA request from the Indiana SEOC to
    the Michigan SEOC, formulate a response (ReqA Part II) in Michigan
    and return it to the Indiana SEOC

      *  Capability 2 Title: ComC 3.4 - Request external resources using
        EMAC and other mutual aid/assistance processes (inter- and
        intra-State)

          *  Activity 2.1 Execute Req-A Part I (IN DHS)

          *  Activity 2.2 Convert Req-A for transmission (IN ARES)

          *  Activity 2.3 Convert transmitted Req-A back to form (MI
            ARES)

          *  Activity 2.4 Execute Req-A Part II (MSP EMHSD)

          *  Activity 2.5 Convert Req-A Part II for transmission (MI
            ARES)

          *  Activity 2.6 Convert transmitted Part II back to form (IN
            ARES)

      *  Capability 3 Title: ComC 5.2 - Establish and ensure connectivity
        with EOC/MACC

          *  Activity 3.1 Transmit message SEOC to SEOC


3.3.Â Scenario Summary
----------------------

A severe earthquake strikes Memphis with strong aftershocks in the Wabash
Valley. Most infrastructure, including virtually all communications
infrastructure, has been destroyed for some distance from the epicenter.
States in the CUSEC group, including Indiana, require assistance.

organized by capability and associated activities. The capabilities
linked to the exercise objectives of Indiana-Michigan Digital Test are
listed below, followed by corresponding activities. Each activity is
followed by related observations, which include references, analysis, and
recommendations.


4.1.Â Capability 1
------------------

Capability Summary: ComC 5.4 - Coordinate communications policy and
procedure across response entities


4.1.1.Â Activity 1.1

Initiate contact between sections

4.1.1.1.Â Observation 1.1.1

Area for Improvement - No forum for regional SECs

4.1.1.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.1.1.2.Â Analysis

When initially setting up this exercise, the SEC for Michigan (the
initiator) had no forum of regional SECs to contact. Rather than knowing
which other jurisdictions would be interested in running this test, it
was necessary to make cold calls to nearby SECs in an attempt to find a
partner. In addition, had there been a forum where regional SECs
discussed issues, the design of the exercise likely would have been
different, having been able to draw from the experiences of other
Sections.

4.1.1.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.1.1.2.Â Observation 1.1.2

Strength - Contact information generally available

4.1.1.2.1.Â References

None

4.1.1.2.2.Â Analysis

Although there is no definitive list of contact information for the SECs,
there are a large number of sources. The ARRL website presumably has the
necessary information, but many SECs have no data there or the data are
incorrect or out of date. However, amateur radio callsigns for all SECs
is available, and with a little research, that is generally enough to
reveal some contact information. This research can take some time,
though, which could be a problem in the event of an actual incident.

4.1.1.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.2.Â Activity 1.2

Agree on outline of exercise

4.1.2.1.Â Observation 1.2.1

Strength - SECs generally see same needs

4.1.2.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.2.1.2.Â Analysis

Each Section is quite different, and has different needs. Nevertheless,
many of the needs are similar and within the context of a relatively
limited exercise such as this, it was not difficult to agree on an
overall outline.

4.1.2.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.3.Â Activity 1.3

Recruit necessary resources

4.1.3.1.Â Observation 1.3.1

Area for Improvement - Differing relationships in sections complicate
process

4.1.3.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.3.1.2.Â Analysis

The relationships between ARES, RACES and NTS are quite different between
the Sections. That initially caused some confusion in trying to identify
resources required to perform the exercise.

4.1.3.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.1.3.2.Â Observation 1.3.2

Area for Improvement - Selection of protocol limits available resources

4.1.3.2.1.Â References

None

4.1.3.2.2.Â Analysis

The intent was to test Pactor communications which, in principle, should
be relatively straightforward. However, there are few individuals with
any sort of digital capability, and fewer still with the knowledge and
equipment to effectively use Pactor.

4.1.3.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.4.Â Activity 1.4

Recruit liaisons with government organizations

4.1.4.1.Â Observation 1.4.1

Strength - States willing to get engaged

4.1.4.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.4.1.2.Â Analysis

Initially the involvement of the government entities was not expected.
However, both the Indiana Department of Homeland Security and the
Michigan State Police Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division
joined in the planning an execution. This added considerably to the value
of the exercise.

4.1.4.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.5.Â Activity 1.5

Develop exercise plan

4.1.5.1.Â Observation 1.5.1

Area for Improvement - Few resources trained in HSEEP

4.1.5.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.5.1.2.Â Analysis

Development of the exercise was handled via web based meetings. Most of
the participants had little or no training in the development of
exercises, so discussions tended to go off track and drag on.

4.1.5.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.6.Â Activity 1.6

Develop communications protocols

4.1.6.1.Â Observation 1.6.1

Area for Improvement - Unfamiliar message caused difficulties

4.1.6.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.6.1.2.Â Analysis

The Req-A selected as a test was quite different than the short messages
practiced daily by NTS. In addition, the form had much detail that did
not need to be transmitted, so considerable effort was expended
determining how best to transmit the message. There was probably an
initial perception that forms of this sort could simply be attached to a
Pactor message. Certainly, the technical capability exists, however,
Pactor over HF is sufficiently slow that any realistic attachment is
simply impractical. Because the initial scope was "digital", a digital
approach was envisioned, and the NTS-style rigor was expected, so methods
centered on "flattening" the message to straight text. In hindsight, it
may well have been more effective to simply read the form over HF phone.

4.1.6.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.1.6.2.Â Observation 1.6.2

Area for Improvement - Solutions highly specific - more general
approaches needed

4.1.6.2.1.Â References

None

4.1.6.2.2.Â Analysis

The primary focus was on the EMAC Req-A form. The Action Request Form
(ARF) was also considered. However, there could be a wide range of other
message types, and the narrow focus meant that those other types were not
considered.

4.1.6.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.1.7.Â Activity 1.7

Execute exercise

4.1.7.1.Â Observation 1.7.1

Area for Improvement - Scheduling was fluid

4.1.7.1.1.Â References

None

4.1.7.1.2.Â Analysis

Last-minute changes were made to the scheduling of the test, which caused
some degree of confusion.

4.1.7.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.1.7.2.Â Observation 1.7.2

Area for Improvement - Not all expected resources were available

4.1.7.2.1.Â References

None

4.1.7.2.2.Â Analysis

Partly because of the high level of skill required, limiting the number
of possible participants, and partly because of last minute changes, not
all of the expected players were able to participate.

4.1.7.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.Â Capability 2
------------------

Capability Summary: ComC 3.4 - Request external resources using EMAC and
other mutual aid/assistance processes (inter- and intra-State)


4.2.1.Â Activity 2.1

Execute Req-A Part I (IN DHS)

4.2.1.1.Â Observation 2.1.1

Strength - This was a familiar process to DHS

4.2.1.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.1.1.2.Â Analysis

The Indiana Department of Homeland Security had been working through the
EMAC process in preparation for the National Level Exercise, so actually
executing the Req-A was somewhat rote.

4.2.1.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.2.Â Activity 2.2

Convert Req-A for transmission (IN ARES)

4.2.2.1.Â Observation 2.2.1

Area for Improvement - Time consuming and error-prone conversion

4.2.2.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.2.1.2.Â Analysis

It was reported by players at the Indiana SEOC that the process of
converting the Req-A form to plain text was time-consuming and error
prone.

4.2.2.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.2.2.2.Â Observation 2.2.2

Area for Improvement - Conversion Req-A specific, there will be other
forms

4.2.2.2.1.Â References

None

4.2.2.2.2.Â Analysis

Methods used to convert the form for transmission were specific to the
Req-A. As mentioned earlier, there are a number of other forms and
messages that might be transmitted, and it is not at all clear that the
same techniques would apply.

4.2.2.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.3.Â Activity 2.3

Convert transmitted Req-A back to form (MI ARES)

4.2.3.1.Â Observation 2.3.1

Strength - Executed without issue

4.2.3.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.3.1.2.Â Analysis

The Michigan SEOC reported no difficulty in taking the transmitted text
and converting it back to the form. The operator simply read the fields
to the MSP representative who entered the data into the form as it was
received.

4.2.3.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.4.Â Activity 2.4

Execute Req-A Part II (MSP EMHSD)

4.2.4.1.Â Observation 2.4.1

Strength - EMHSD very concerned about appropriate response

4.2.4.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.4.1.2.Â Analysis

Although amateurs were not very concerned about the content of the
message, only its accurate transmission, MSP wanted to be sure that
whatever left the Michigan SEOC was realistic. This added to the realism
and effectiveness of the exercise.

4.2.4.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.2.4.2.Â Observation 2.4.2

Strength - EMHSD had prepared responses (mission packages)

4.2.4.2.1.Â References

None

4.2.4.2.2.Â Analysis

In preparation for play during the NLE, Michigan had prepared Req-A
responses ahead of time. The actual generation of a response to a Req-A
is a rather complex, time-consuming process. By having responses prepared
for likely requests ahead of time, which EMHSD called "mission packages",
MSP was in a position to respond more quickly.

4.2.4.2.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.5.Â Activity 2.5

Convert Req-A Part II for transmission (MI ARES)

4.2.5.1.Â Observation 2.5.1

Strength - Little problem but done on the fly

4.2.5.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.5.1.2.Â Analysis

Operators at the Michigan SEOC reported no difficulty in preparing the
response for transmission.

4.2.5.1.3.Â Recommendations


4.2.6.Â Activity 2.6

Convert transmitted Part II back to form (IN ARES)

4.2.6.1.Â Observation 2.6.1

Area for Improvement - No feedback, cycle took too long

4.2.6.1.1.Â References

None

4.2.6.1.2.Â Analysis

Due to the propagation difficulties and the length of time taken for the
transmissions, the response to Indiana arrived after play was complete.

Capability Summary: ComC 5.2 - Establish and ensure connectivity with
EOC/MACC


4.3.1.Â Activity 3.1

Transmit message SEOC to SEOC

4.3.1.1.Â Observation 3.1.1

Area for Improvement - Conditions prevented IN SEOC from reaching hub

4.3.1.1.1.Â References

None

4.3.1.1.2.Â Analysis

The Indiana SEOC had intended to deliver the message to a nearby NTSD hub
(WB9FHP). However, conditions on 80 meters did not permit reaching WB9FHP
during the exercise, and the hub does not switch to 40 except in the
evening.

4.3.1.1.3.Â Recommendations

4.3.1.2.Â Observation 3.1.2

Area for Improvement - Lack of familiarity with NTSD eliminated alternate
hub as an option

4.3.1.2.1.Â References

None

4.3.1.2.2.Â Analysis

It is quite likely that Indiana could have delivered the message to W8UL.
however, W8UL has a rather complex frequency scanning schedule, and
operators at the Indiana SEOC were not famiiar with that schedule.

4.3.1.2.3.Â Recommendations

4.3.1.3.Â Observation 3.1.3

Area for Improvement - Deep knowledge of NTSD allowed message to be
retrieved

4.3.1.3.1.Â References

None

4.3.1.3.2.Â Analysis

The WB9FHP hub has some specialized capabilities, and the message was
eventually delivered there, but through a different mechanism than
expected. The message was successfully retrieved from WB9FHP by WB9JSR.
However, a slightly different mechanism was required. This was only
possible because WB9JSR had the knowledge and experience to recognize
what was needed. Most other operators would not have been successful.

4.3.1.3.3.Â Recommendations

4.3.1.4.Â Observation 3.1.4

Area for Improvement - Olivia path from JSR to MTL very slow

4.3.1.4.1.Â References

None

4.3.1.4.2.Â Analysis

The message was transmitted from WB9JSR to KD8MTL via Olivia. This proved
to be quite slow, and required a number of fills.

4.3.1.4.3.Â Recommendations

4.3.1.5.Â Observation 3.1.5

Area for Improvement - Choice of "digital" limited options we may have
chosen (40 phone)

4.3.1.5.1.Â References

None

4.3.1.5.2.Â Analysis

Because the exercise was framed as a digital exercise, only digital modes
were used. In a real-world situation, a direct HF phone or CW circuit
between the SEOCs would likely have been established. Operators were
reluctant to "break the rules" and select a more straightforward
approach.

ChapterÂ 5.Â Conclusion
-----------------------

The EMAC request was successfully transmitted from the Indiana SEOC to
the Michigan SEOC, a response created, and transmitted back to the
Indiana SEOC. Although the traffic was able to make the trip, a number of
challenges were encountered:

  *  The intention was to use NTSD for as much of the trip as possible,
    although Michigan's SEOC was not equipped for Pactor necessitating a
    different mode for the final leg. There are a large number of
    challenges which may make NTSD in particular, and perhaps even Pactor
    in general, a poor choice.

  *  Some of the paths selected depended on "typical" propagation
    conditions. Conditions are rarely typical and alternatives must be
    available and documented ahead of time.

  *  The use of digital modes, and especially Pactor, requires skilled
    operators which are small in number. It might make more sense to use
    more traditional modes, even if other modes might seem better at
    first glance.

Going forward, much work should be done:

  *  The range of documents that might need to be moved between states
    should be identified, and differences understood.

  *  Procedures for handling those documents between the states should be
    developed, tested, and agreed upon.

  *  Additional states in the region should be engaged in the discussion.
    This exercise uncovered differences between Indiana and Michigan;
    there is no reason to suspect that there aren't greater differences
    to be dealt with as additional states are engaged.

Overall, this exercise uncovered a number of areas where improvement is
needed, and thus was extremely worthwhile. The Indiana and Michigan
Sections would especially like to thank the Indiana Department of
Homeland Security, and the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management
and Homeland Security Division for their assistance. Without them the
exercise may well have overlooked some important components.
