		The EMAC request was successfully transmitted from the Indiana SEOC to the Michigan SEOC, a response created, and transmitted back to the Indiana SEOC. Although the traffic was able to make the trip, a number of challenges were encountered: 
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					The intention was to use NTSD for as much of the trip as possible, although Michigan's SEOC was not equipped for Pactor necessitating a different mode for the final leg. There are a large number of challenges which may make NTSD in particular, and perhaps even Pactor in general, a poor choice.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Some of the paths selected depended on "typical" propagation conditions. Conditions are rarely typical and alternatives must be available and documented ahead of time.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					The use of digital modes, and especially Pactor, requires skilled operators which are small in number. It might make more sense to use more traditional modes, even if other modes might seem better at first glance.
				</div></li></ul></div>

	</div><div class="para">
		Going forward, much work should be done: 
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					The range of documents that might need to be moved between states should be identified, and differences understood.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Procedures for handling those documents between the states should be developed, tested, and agreed upon.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Additional states in the region should be engaged in the discussion. This exercise uncovered differences between Indiana and Michigan; there is no reason to suspect that there aren't greater differences to be dealt with as additional states are engaged.
				</div></li></ul></div>

	</div><div class="para">
		Overall, this exercise uncovered a number of areas where improvement is needed, and thus was extremely worthwhile. The Indiana and Michigan Sections would especially like to thank the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, and the Michigan State Police, Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division for their assistance. Without them the exercise may well have overlooked some important components.
