			FEMA planned a "National Level Exercise" around a large earthquake event in the central United States. The Sections had conducted a number of small drills with neighboring states, but the planned NLE presented a realistic scenario in which amateur radio might be required to provide communications between State EOCs.
		</div><div class="para">
			In discussions with the Indiana Department of Homeland Security it was determined that a probable SEOC to SEOC message would be an Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) request, prepared on a form called a "Req-A". This form is quite long, and unlike the kinds of traffic practiced regularly by the National Traffic System (NTS).
		</div><div class="para">
			The longer message would better be handled by digital means. The National Traffic System maintains a digital infrastructure, NTSD, which transmits messages using an email-like protocol over radio. It was decided to use this mechanism, even though NTSD-capable stations are small in number. Since MARS maintains a similar infrastructure, a decision was made to attempt the same traffic over both NTSD and MARS circuits.

			Although MARS participated in the exercise, this document focuses on ARPSC results. MARS processes and structure is somewhat different, as are the available modes and frequencies. It is expected that MARS will also produce an after action report based around their organization and processes.
