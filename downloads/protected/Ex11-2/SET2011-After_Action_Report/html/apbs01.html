						The Liaison who was monitoring the SEOC phone Net picked up three messages and brought them to the MIDTN, messages # 2, 4, 9 and where picked up and acknowledged by all four Counties in the NET. A repeat was not needed as they where monitoring the NET.

						MIDTN as well as Roscommon, Alpena and Presque Isle all had Emergency Power Sources and switched over and rechecked into the NET to acknowledge same
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						We operated from the Roscommon Fairgrounds as a field day type station and erected antennas and used equipment we brought to the scene. I worked elbow to elbow with the DEC (Red) and he spent a great deal of time after the exercise teaching me what I needed to do to function better as a Manager of the NET
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						I checked into QMN because the statewide SSB nets were very weak into this location. Also, they were yakking away for minutes at a time, explaining why things were like they were
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Major concern on these nets were on frequencies other than their usual frequencies. Also, I believe some folks on the 3553 KHz freq for QMN were likewise concerned.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Repeater contacts went well with all stations hearing everyone. Analog simplex contacts were generally acceptable, but we found that some electrical noise at the Coldwater PD/FD was not allowing them to hear weak signals. D-Star simplex contacts had the same result as analog simplex as a result of the high noise levels at CPD. Steuben has no D-Star capability at this time. The high noise levels have been resolved at CPD by utilizing adding grounding to the shield of our antenna run.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Both the Hillsdale and Branch EOCs had extreme electronic noise and no packet connections were possible. We are using toroids and grounding devices to try to quiet things down but we are not there yet.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						We had 17 participants with 16 on emergency power.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						The contact with Kalamazoo on the 04 repeater was successful from the EOC. The Coldwater hospital had difficulty. Virtually everything on simplex and D-Star failed. We question band conditions because this has not been particularly problematic in the past. Will test again in November.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Checking into the MACS Net went well. We received 4 pieces of traffic and we sent 1 response to the SEOC. Over all, my impression was that the HF link to limited stations who communicated with the SEOC worked very well. This moved the gridlock away from the SEOC. I did not have the chance to listen to anything but the MACS Net, so things may have gone to hell in a hand basket elsewhere. At least there were trained traffic handlers at the SEOC and at the helm of the HF Nets. This exercise illustrates that ARES and RACES groups need a ton of work on how to properly and accurately formulate and relay written messages to another operator. This is Deja vu all over again!!!!
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Our monthly Tornado Siren Test went off well, after the power cable of the signaling equipment at the 911 Center was plugged back in. It turns out that some things at 911 had been rearranged and they neglected to plug the unit back in. Good thing they test things!!!!
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Moving frequencies off usual freqs created considerable confusion.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						I was a W8DC, and was assigned to monitor 3932 KHz, but signals were so weak I could hardly hear anyone. So, I moved here to 3553 KHz for QMN, even though QMN was supposed to be for District 1 only (at least that was my impression.) Best laid plans of mice and men often go astray in emergency.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Moving to 7 MHz was a fine idea, but I wasn't sure everyone heard the QNC to move, so I voluteered to run a parallel session on 3.5 MHz. I found W8OAK, quite weak, but he was able to hear enough to move to 7068 KHz and, apparently moved his traffic.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						The SEOC had a good signal during the two hours I operated. Conditions were fair to good. No problems here.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						It's refreshing to know that we have sufficient depth of operators with CW skills so that a CW operator at the SEOC is available for the exercise.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						The segregated net concept, that is, a watch frequency for the SEOC and a separate net frequency for QMN was problematic. While this may have worked well for the voice nets, which tend to have a larger contingent of operators, it tended to divide the limited resources of QMN. Rather than resulting in greater efficiency, it resulted in a cumbersome flow of traffic and duplication of resources.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Operations during the 8:00-AM to 8:20-AM EDT time frame on 3563 was hampered by strong digital interference. I did not have the capabilities to decode the traffic. However, it was quite strong at my location. It seems to me the risk of such frequency conflicts is greater when nets are moved off their normal frequencies or when special nets are established without thought given to frequency coordination and potential conflicts. For example, when the QMN frequencies were selected (both primary and alternate), considerable time and monitoring was invested to make sure the conflict with other nets throughout the day would be minimized. Of course, there are no guarantees, but it seems to me such interference could have been problematic in a real communications emergency.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						The procedures and message traffic originated and relayed was quite good. All operators involved did a fine job.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Message 001: The x-ray at the conclusion of the text and before the second break (to signature) was unnecessary.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						In time of emergency, and therefore in drills and exercises, the message should have included a time of origination.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Message 007: No time of origin. This is a potential problem in an Emergency Operations Center when multiple messages may be received about a single event. In order for an agency or individual to construct a coherent understanding of an event, it is necessary to know the sequence of the event components, inquiries, and actions that take place. Otherwise, errors in judgment occur. The time of origin should reflect the time at which the message was drafted by the signatory. As such, automatic time stamp at time of entry into a network is inaccurate and inappropriate (e.g. packet time stamp, e-mail time stamp, etc.).
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Message 007: Who is requesting the information? If I were to contact my local DPW or Road Commission and make this inquiry, someone is bound to ask "on whose authority are you making this request and who wants the information?" It is also likely to generate a reply; to whom is that reply addressed? When a message is originated on behalf of the SEOC, it should have an authorizing signature. Obviously, no harm no foul as this was a drill message, but in real life, it should include a name, title and agency in the signature line.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						I attempted to access the W8HVG link system, but the St. Joseph repeater was locked key-down all day. Not sure if this was an interference problem or malicious.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Thank you to K8KIC for checking in on behalf of District One! A life-saver. We need more members in District One.
