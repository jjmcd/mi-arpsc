			Each year the Michigan Section uses the annual ARRL Simulated Emergency Test to conduct a statewide exercise to improve the ability of the Section to respond to emergencies and other incidents, and to interact with various State and local agencies, as well as NGOs.
		</div><div class="para">
			Over the past few years the Section has been working on improving the interface between the National traffic System and ARES. This year the Section hoped to establish some more or less permanent relationships between the ARES Districts and the NTS nets. Each District was assigned a net, and an additional net was assigned the responsibility of working with the National Weather Service. (refer to <a class="xref" href="appe-nts-dist.html" title="F. NTS to District Assignments">Appendix F, <i>NTS to District Assignments</i></a> for details.) The Thumb and Mid Michigan Traffic Net was not assigned a District as there were no obvious candidates and the net has a relatively small footprint. The Northern Lower Eastern Upper Peninsula Net was also not assigned as that net has no current leadership.
		</div><div class="para">
			The exercise was designed to exercise these new relationships, and also test the ability of the nets and local programs to respond to challenging conditions such as loss of repeater power, loss of antennas, etc.
		</div><div class="para">
			As with most Statewide ARES/NTS exercises, it was a particular challenge to design a scenario where all participating counties and nets could send and receive relevant traffic. The Training and Exercise Officer polled all Districts to see which would participate, and only three responded in the affirmative. At least a few counties from every District did participate, so some counties received only generic traffic.
