		[When a jurisdiction/organization elects to use performance ratings, or when initiatives require a rating within the AAR/IP, the following approach can be used. A qualitative performance rating is assigned to each activity demonstrated within its capability area. The performance rating is based on a systemic review by the lead evaluator of exercise performance based on evaluator analysis of how well the participants demonstrated the capability outcome. The results should be summarized within this appendix and should be based on the supporting narrative contained within the body of the AAR/IP.]
