						Communications involving SET - with other nets that usually meet during this time period woule solve a lot of time and net problems - reference the Old Geisers net - Communications with them ahead of time about the SET so they could QSY the net ahead of time
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Traffic being repeated at too fast a pace verbally - repeated msg incorrect - District not getting the State traffic in a timely fashion - reliability and accuracy
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Operators need more practice copying messages - station on freq not prepared to copy - xray in message not being put into word count causing confusion

						It became obvious that the 5th District has a big administrative communications problem. It wasn't for lack of trying to get the SET word out. The problem was that 2 of 4 counties, Allegan and Calhoun, kept their operations a secret. Allegan Co. Operated in a vacuum but had a busy county-only exercise. There ids a 5th district yahoo egroup the works well if people use it."

						As Kalamazoo County EC, NK8X read all of the traffic from the SEOC on the local VHF-FM net frequency. NK8X also assisted the NCS on 3952 as a relay. 75 meters pooped out around 10:30AM."
