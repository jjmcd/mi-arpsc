		Each year on the first Saturday in October, the ARRL holds a "Simulated Emergency Test". The Michigan Section has long used this as an annual exercise to help develop various skills needed for emergency response.

		The Michigan Section winter storm functional drill exercise 2011 Simulated Emergency Test was developed to test Michigan Section's ComA2.4.3.1 (Procedures and plans) and ComC1.2.2 (Interoperable comms) capabilities. The exercise planning team was composed of SEC staff. The exercise planning team discussed the ARES/NTS interface, message handling, congestion at the SEOC during a statewide incident, and response to infrastructure failures.
	</div><div class="para">
		Based on the exercise planning team's deliberations, the following objectives were developed for 2011 Simulated Emergency Test: 
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Objective 1: Improve the relationship between ARES and NTS by assigning permanent NTS Net to ARES District relationships.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Objective 2: Introduce ARES to the standard NTS practice of having liaisons carry traffic to and from a net.
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Objective 3: Stress message passing by introducing constraints to simulate widespread infrastructure outages, such as loss of power and antennas.
				</div></li></ul></div>

	</div><div class="para">
		The purpose of this report is to analyze exercise results, identify strengths to be maintained and built upon, identify potential areas for further improvement, and support development of corrective actions.

			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						District Emergency Coordinators and Net Managers worked efectively prior to the exercise to have plans in place.

			Throughout the exercise, several opportunities for improvement in the Section's ability to respond to the incident were identified. The primary areas for improvement, including recommendations, are as follows: 
			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Net procedures still presented some areas of confusion. Additional practice is indicated.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Not all jurisdictions had plans for relieving operators in key positions. The need for written plans, including plans for dealing with multiple operational periods, must be stressed with the counties.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						While procedures and net discipline showed considerable improvement, there were still a number of areas where inexperience delayed traffic. Once again, additional training and practice is indicated.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						Many participants, especially nets, were reluctant to leave their comfort zones. In particular, nets seemed to have difficulty leaving their favored frequencies, modes and practices, even when other approaches would obviously have been more effective.
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						While Section staff made significant efforts to make ARPSC members aware of the exercise, non-participants were for the most part unaware, even if they might be affected. Broader dissemination of plans is needed.
