    <para>
      Each year on the first Saturday in October, the ARRL holds a
      "Simulated Emergency Test".  The Michigan Section has long used
      this as an annual exercise to help develop various skills needed
      for emergency response.

      When writing the Executive Summary, keep in mind that this section may be
      the only part of the AAR/IP that some people will read.  Introduce this
      section by stating the full name of the exercise and providing a brief
      overview of the exercise.  This brief overview should discuss why the
      exercise was conducted; the exercise objectives; and what Target
      Capabilities List (TCL) capabilities, activities, and scenario(s) were
      used to achieve those objectives.  All of these areas will be discussed in
      more detail in the subsequent chapters of the AAR/IP.  In addition, the
      Executive Summary may be used to summarize any high-level observations
      that cut across multiple capabilities.]

      The &JURIS; &SCEN; &EXTYPE; exercise &EXNAM; was developed to
      test &JURIS;'s ComA2.4.3.1 (Procedures and plans) and ComC1.2.2
      (Interoperable comms) capabilities.  The exercise planning team
      was composed of SEC staff.  The exercise planning team discussed
      the ARES/NTS interface, message handling, congestion at the SEOC
      during a statewide incident, and response to infrastructure
      failures.
    </para>
    <para>
      Based on the exercise planning team's deliberations, the following
      objectives were developed for &EXNAM;:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Objective 1: Improve the relationship between ARES and NTS
	    by assigning permanent NTS Net to ARES District
	    relationships.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Objective 2: Introduce ARES to the standard NTS practice
	    of having liaisons carry traffic to and from a net.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Objective 3: Stress message passing by introducing
	    constraints to simulate widespread infrastructure outages,
	    such as loss of power and antennas.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      The purpose of this report is to analyze exercise results, identify
      strengths to be maintained and built upon, identify potential areas for
      further improvement, and support development of corrective actions.
    </para>

      be limited to three each to ensure the Executive Summary is high-level and

	Throughout the exercise, several opportunities for improvement
	in the Section's ability to respond to the incident were
	identified.  The primary areas for improvement, including
	recommendations, are as follows:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Net procedures still presented some areas of confusion.
	      Additional practice is indicated.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Not all jurisdictions had plans for relieving operators
	      in key positions.  The need for written plans, including
	      plans for dealing with multiple operational periods,
	      must be stressed with the counties.
 	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      While procedures and net discipline showed considerable
	      improvement, there were still a number of areas where
	      inexperience delayed traffic.  Once again, additional
	      training and practice is indicated.
 	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Many participants, especially nets, were reluctant to
	      leave their comfort zones.  In particular, nets seemed
	      to have difficulty leaving their favored frequencies,
	      modes and practices, even when other approaches would
	      obviously have been more effective.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      While Section staff made significant efforts to make
	      ARPSC members aware of the exercise, non-participants
	      were for the most part unaware, even if they might be
	      affected.  Broader dissemination of plans is needed.
