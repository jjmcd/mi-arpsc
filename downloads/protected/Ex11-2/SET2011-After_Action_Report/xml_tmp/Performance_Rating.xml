  <para>
    [When a jurisdiction/organization elects to use performance ratings, or when
    initiatives require a rating within the AAR/IP, the following approach can
    be used.  A qualitative performance rating is assigned to each activity
    demonstrated within its capability area.  The performance rating is based on
    a systemic review by the lead evaluator of exercise performance based on
    evaluator analysis of how well the participants demonstrated the capability
    outcome.  The results should be summarized within this appendix and should
    be based on the supporting narrative contained within the body of the
    AAR/IP.]
  </para>
  <para>
    The performance rating categories refer to how well each activity was
    performed during the exercise and are detailed in the table below.
