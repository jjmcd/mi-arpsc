      Each year the Michigan Section uses the annual ARRL Simulated
      Emergency Test to conduct a statewide exercise to improve the
      ability of the Section to respond to emergencies and other
      incidents, and to interact with various State and local
      agencies, as well as NGOs.
    </para>
    <para>
      Over the past few years the Section has been working on
      improving the interface between the National traffic System and
      ARES.  This year the Section hoped to establish some more or
      less permanent relationships between the ARES Districts and the
      NTS nets.  Each District was assigned a net, and an additional
      net was assigned the responsibility of working with the National
      Weather Service. (refer to <xref linkend="appe-nts-dist" /> for
      details. The Thumb and Mid Michigan Traffic Net was not assigned
      a District as there were no obvious candidates and the net has a
      relatively small footprint.  The Northern Lower Eastern Upper
      Peninsula Net was also not assigned as that net has no current
      leadership.
    </para>
    <para>
      The exercise was designed to exercise these new relationships,
      and also test the ability of the nets and local programs to
      respond to challenging conditions such as loss of repeater
      power, loss of antennas, etc.
    </para>
    <para>
      As with most Statewide ARES/NTS exercises, it was a particular
      challenge to design a scenario where all participating
      counties and nets could send and receive relevant traffic.
      The Training and Exercise Officer polled all Districts to see
      which would participate, and only three responded in the
      affirmative.  At least a few counties from every District did
      participate, so some counties received only generic traffic.

      Capabilities-based planning allows for exercise planning teams to
      develop exercise objectives and observe exercise outcomes through a
      framework of specific action items that were derived from the Target
      Capabilities List (TCL).  The capabilities listed below form the
      foundation for the organization of all objectives and observations in
      this exercise.  Additionally, each capability is linked to several
      corresponding activities and tasks to provide additional detail.

      Based upon the identified exercise objectives below, the
      exercise planning team has decided to demonstrate the following

      A severe winter storm scenario was selected as this type of
      incident can realistically have widespread and severe
      consequences.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the early morning of October 1, the National Weather Service
      in White Lake issues a warning of an impending severe winter
      storm.  By the time the SEOC is activated and warnings sent to
      the Districts, telephone service is already affected.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the morning wears on, severe icing and heavy winds cause
      damage to power lines and higher profile antennas.  Many
      repeaters are forced off the air and even some HF antennas
      suffer damage.  Local jurisdictions are forced to rely on backup
      repeaters, emergency power stations, and simplex operation.  A
      short summary of the events may be found in <xref
      linkend="appe-events-summary" />.
    </para>
    <para>
      Injects for the exercise are delivered to Districts and some
      individual counties via radiogram (refer to <xref
      linkend="appe-msel" />).  The various NTS nets send liaisons to
      the SEOC to pick up and deliver traffic between the SEOC and
      their assigned Districts and the counties within that District.
