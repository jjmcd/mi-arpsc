		This exercise aimed to strengthen the relationship between the Amateur Radio Emergency Services (ARES) and the National Traffic System (NTS). The station at the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) delivered injects to liaisons to the various NTS nets who, in turn, delivered those injects to the Districts.
	</div><div class="para">
		Each District was assigned an NTS net, with the expectation that this assignment would be more or less permanent. ARES District Emergency Coordinators were encouraged to work together with NTS Net Managers to plan meeting times, frequencies, etc. The Great Lakes Emergency and traffic Net was assigned the responsibility of representing the four National Weather Service offices in Michigan.
	</div><div class="para">
		Evaluators monitored the activity looking for evidence of planning, ability to maintain communications across the state, and ability to respond to loss of infrastructure.
	</div><div class="para">
		As this exercise was conducted in conjunction with the annual ARRL Simulated Emergency Test, individual jurisdictions were encouraged to include local government agencies and NGOs in their local activities.
