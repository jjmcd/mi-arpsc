Abstract

Each October the ARRL holds a national event called the Simulated
Emergency Test. Although ARRL's view of this event is more of a contest,
it has been the practice of the Michigan Section to use the SET as an
exercise opportunity. For the past few years the Section has been using
exercises as an opportunity to improve the interface between the ARES and
NTS organizations. During the May 20011 National Level Event, additional
opportunities for improvement became apparent. This document is an
attempt to elucidate some ideas which would permit the 2011 Simulated
Emergency Test to be used to help move those improvements forward.

1.Â Introduction
----------------

Each October, the ARRL holds a "Simulated Emergency Test". Although it
provides an excuse for an exercise, the SET is actually a contest. Unlike
most contests where points are awarded for the number of contacts and
number of sections contacted, points for SET are awarded for the number
of agencies involved. For several years, Michigan has used SET as an
excuse for an exercise, and has focused on various skills. In some years
we focused on packet, others on deployment, more recently we have been
working on the NTS interface. After the May NM11 exercise, a post
exercise meeting was held at the Midland Hamfest. A number of issues
became evident during the May exercise which were discussed. Much of the
discussion centered around congestion at the SEOC. With this backdrop,
this paper introduces some thoughts for the 2011 SET and how we might use
it to test some alternative methods for interfacing with the SEOC.


2.Â Capabilities to be exercised
--------------------------------

Exercises should be designed to test specific capabilities. FEMA has
provided a "Universal Task List", identifying the specific tasks reqiured
for responding to all hazards. These tasks are grouped into five areas;
an area for each of the emergency management missions, and a "Common
Capabilities" area representing those capabilities needed across all
missions:

  *  Common Capabilities

  *  Prevent

  *  Protect

  *  Respond

  *  Recover

Each of these areas is further subdivided. As communications providers,
much of our responsibility falls under the Common Capabilities area, and
especially the subcategory, "Communications". However, most of the tasks
within the Common Capabilities area apply to us, as do many of the tasks
within the other mission areas, especially Respond. A complete list of
the tasks witin the Common Capabilities area is included in the
appendices to this paper Based on the deficiencies exposed in the May
exercise, it would make sense to focus the next exercise on two tasks:

  *  ComA2.4.3.1 - Develop Standard Operating Procedures and Standard
    Operating Guides in support of Emergency Operations Plans

  *  ComC1.2.2 - Develop common communication and data standards to
    facilitate the exchange of information in support of response
    management

Clearly, many of the taks within the Communications section are
applicable to almost any action taken by ARES/RACES, but these two seem
appropriate areas of focus for this upcoming exercise. For reference, the
tasks within the "Common Capabilites" are listed in Appendix A. Appendix
E lists all the Target Capabilities, along with the top level headings
for the tasks within those capabilities. The entire Universal Task List
encompasses thousands of tasks.


3.Â Issues to address
---------------------

A number of issues have arisen in past exercises that should be
addressed. Not all will or should be addressed in a single exercise,
however, some of the key issues should be touched, and are enumerated
below.


3.1.Â SEOC as Net Control

On some occasions, the SEOC has atrempted to act as a net control
station. While at times this has worked, at other times, especially when
there is a lot of traffic or when the SEOC becomes particularly busy,
this has not worked well. Indeed, most counties have found that it is
better to run SKYWARN net control from an isolated location, so NCS may
focus on the net, and be isolated to a degree from operational
distractions. During some SEOC activations, the level of distraction at
the station, even though it is isolated from the SEOC proper, can be
substantial. Given the large number of stations that are active when the
SEOC station is active, it may not even make sense for the SEOC station
to join a net, let alone serve as NCS.


3.2.Â Interface between ARES and NTS

In recent exercises the Section has attempted to route most taffic
through NTS. This leads to a large number of advantages, and has worked
well. However, improvements are still possible. A few of the shortcomings
noted:

  *  NTS operators do not always know what frequency to report to or when

  *  ARES operators are unaware of nets or their capabilities

  *  ARES operators are unfamiliar with NTS procedures

  *  ARES operators are unfamiliar with directed nets

  *  NTS operators are unfamiliar with ARES procedures and organization

  *  NTS leadership does not take ownership of emergency operations


4.Â Possible Approaches
-----------------------

If one steps back and looks at what we are attempting, it seems we
largely have the capabilities in place, but have failed to exploit them.
It would seem that falling back to "standard" operational procedures, and
adding some permanance to the relationships may help significantly.


4.1.Â ARES-NTS Relationships

For this exercise, it is proposed that we implement what we hope to
become a more or less permanant relationship between the Affiliated
Section Nets and the ARES Districts. Each District will be assigned a
net, and each net a District, with the expectation that this relationship
will remain past the exercise, extending not only to future Section-wide
exercises, but quite possibly also to District and local exercises where
it becomes appropriate. It is expected that each Net Manager will develop
a relationship with a District Emergency Coordinator. In this way each
can develop an understanding of the skills, capabilities and needs of the
other. We have moved in this direction in earlier exercises, but never
with the intention that the relationship be more or less permanent. The
nets do not neatly overlay the Districts, so the relationship isn't
always obvious. Key criteria for matching the District with the net
should include such considerations as the net's coverage, distribution of
membership, and proximity of the Net Manager to the District Emergency
Coordinator.


4.2.Â Liaison to the SEOC

It has long been the practice of traffic nets to collect traffic on a
net, then send a liaison to another outlet to forward the traffic. Rather
than encourage congestion on the SEOC operating frequencies, it only
makes sense for the nets to each send a liaison to SEOC to bring traffic
to/from the SEOC station. Since the SEOC can operate two frequencies
simultaneously, and the nets need only one member to act as liaison to
the SEOC, rather than 83 stations all trying to contact the SEOC on a
single frequency, there would be only four stations on each of two
frequencies. This would imply that some phone nets would contact the SEOC
on CW, but all of the HF nets (at least) have some CW capable members.
Traffic Flow Traffic Flow

FigureÂ 1.Â Traffic Flow


The above figure outlines the proposal for alignment between Districts
and nets. Black lines indicate liaison with SEOC on 3.563 MHz, while
violet lines indicate contact on 3.932 MHz.


4.3.Â Net ownership of response duties

In previous exercises, nets were often micromanaged by the STM,
specifying meeting times, frequencies, etc. This worked better than
giving vague instructions to the net manager with the expectation that
they would "deal with it", but in the event of an actual incident, is
quite unrealstic. If they are to be at all useful in an actual event, the
nets must understand their responsibilities, and net managers must
develop strategies for activating their net at unusual times and/or
frequencies. By assigning Districts to nets more or less permanently, the
nets have a better defined scope, and a "customer" with whom they may
develop a relationship. For the coming SET (and hopefully future
exercises and incidents), it is expected that each Net Manager will
contact the corresponding District Emergency Coordinator and arrange net
schedules, frequencies, net controls and liaisons. Note that all nets
should expect to send a liaison to the SEOC early in the event, but other
times need to be worked out between the net and the District. Since
exercises typically last only a few hours, a net may choose to meet for
the duration of the event, or may elect to schedule specific times of
contact so that the counties have targeted times for which to prepare
traffic. While most nets may choose to meet on their normal frequencies,
note that the SEOC will be occupying the GLETN and QMN frequencies, which
happen to be the Michigan phone and CW emergency frequencies, so these
nets will need to select alternate frequences.


4.4.Â "Outlier" nets

There are a few affiliated nets which have unusual duties or are omitted.
There are seven districts and four NWS offices. The NWS offices do not
offer the complexity of a District; i.e. they have no further
subdivisions. There are some nets that share a Net Manager. Not every
District has a Net Manager residing in that District. This inevitably
leads to a certain amount of unevenness in how the nets are treated. The
strategy shown above attempts to minimize that unevenness. MITN and SEMTN
share a Net Manager. That Net Manager happens to reside in a district not
fully covered by SEMTN, but adjacent. That Net Manager has double work
for this exercise. TMMTN is in District 3, but covers only a small
fraction of that District. The Net Manager for TMMTN is also the Net
Manager for GLETN. In addition, GLETN has some special challenges, so
rather than assign that Net Manager double duty, TMMTN was left out of
the plan. GLETN has the widest coverage of all the nets, so that net was
assigned the 4 NWS offices which represent the most geographically
disparate group. There is considerable unevenness in the NWS offices, so
even though this assignment represents the smallest group of contacts, it
presents some special challenges. NLEUP is without a Net Manager and
appears to have been more or less dormant for some time. NLEUP has thus
been left out also. QMN has an assignment that is outside the District
where the Net Manager resides, similarly for MACS. However, both of these
Net Managers reside within repeater range of their served Districts and
both nets include membership from these Districts.


5.Â Exercise Evaluation
-----------------------

In order to gain as much as possible from the exercise, a more formal
evaluation will be used (although not quite as formal as expected in the
HSEEP). Each DEC is expected to recruit an evaluator who will not
participate in the exercise, but rather will stand by and observe. The
evaluator is expected to join a phone conference for evaluators prior to
the exercise.


5.1.Â No players at the evaluators conference

In order to maintain the integrity of the exercise, and especially the
evaluation, it is important that anyone who attends the evaluator
conference does not participate as a player in the exercise.


5.2.Â Exercise Evaluation Guide

The SEC will provide the evaluators with an Exercise Evaluation Guide
(EEG) prior to SET. This guide is only available to evaluators and will
be used by the evaluator during the exercise. In preparing the EEG, the
SEC will select a small number of the "Preparedness Criteria" listed by
FEMA for the tasks we are exercising. The complete list of the relevant
preparedness criteria may be found in Appendix D.


5.3.Â After Action Evaluator's Conference

Following the SET and the return of the EEGs to the SEC, an After Action
conference will be held with the evaluators and the controllers. Using
information collected in this conference, a draft After Action Report
will be developed. A second conference including Net Managers and DECs
will be held to finalize the report.


6.Â Specific Assignments
------------------------

Prior to the exercise the Net Managers and DECs need to take care of a
few details.


6.1.Â District Emergency Coordinators

Prior to SET each DEC should:

  *  Contact the appropriate Net Manager and arrange meeting times,
    frequencies (refer to Appendix B)

  *  Identify an evaluator for the District. The Evaluator should be
    expected to monitor the District's on the air activities during the
    SET, participate in the Evaluator's Conference on September 21,
    return the EEG to the SEC promptly, and participate in the
    Evaluator's After Action Conference. Advise the SEC of the Evaluator
    by September 14, providing call and contact information.

  *  Contact each member county, identify who intends to participate, and
    arrange for appropriate contact between the county and the District
    (in case the net frequency is expected to be congested or a county
    cannot muster the necessary capabilities).

  *  For each county, identify any served agencies that intend to
    participate, and provide that information to the Training and
    Exercise Officer no later than September 14 (hutchesonjohn@att.net).

  *  Remind each Emergency Coordinator that they should plan to send a
    report in to Headquarters following SET. Emergency Coordinators
    should report on "Form A" found at
    http://www.arrl.org/public-service-field-services-forms. Remind ECs
    that this report is much easier to fill out on the day of SET than
    later on after the details have become fuzzy.

  *  For each resource to be used, be aware of emergency power
    capabilities; type of power, running time available, ability to be
    reloaded.

  *  For any repeaters or other resources to be used, coordinate with the
    owners of those resources to ensure their availability for the SET.


6.2.Â Net Managers

Prior to the SET, each Net Manager should:

  *  Contact the appropriate DEC (refer to Appendix C) and arrange
    meeting times, frequencies, and get an understanding of the groups
    maturity with respect to traffic handling procedures and net
    discipline.

  *  Schedule net controls as needed for the event.

  *  Recruit liaison stations having the capability to contact the SEOC
    as well as to participate with the counties.

  *  Advise net members of meeting times, frequencies, and your
    expectations for the members.

  *  Be aware of each net member's emergency power capabilities. Remember
    that not all types of emergency power have the same useable lifetime.
    Keep in mind that, for example, it may not be possible to refuel a
    gasoline powered generator if there is a widespread outage, and gas
    stations will not be able to pump fuel. Consider fallbacks such as CW
    so that stations may extend their lifetime by operating at lower
    power. Alternatively, consider rotating NCS stations so that any one
    station's transmitting time is reduced. Note that in most cases, the
    SEOC is in a position to receive CW on the phone as well as CW
    frequency.

  *  Net Managers should review ARRL "Form B" found at
    http://www.arrl.org/public-service-field-services-forms and send in
    the completed form after the event. Net Managers should note that
    this is a pretty simple report if completed the day of the SET, but
    could be challenging if put off until near the due date of Feb, 2012.
