		Each October, the ARRL holds a "Simulated Emergency Test". Although it provides an excuse for an exercise, the SET is actually a contest. Unlike most contests where points are awarded for the number of contacts and number of sections contacted, points for SET are awarded for the number of agencies involved.
	</div><div class="para">
		For several years, Michigan has used SET as an excuse for an exercise, and has focused on various skills. In some years we focused on packet, others on deployment, more recently we have been working on the NTS interface.
	</div><div class="para">
		After the May NM11 exercise, a post exercise meeting was held at the Midland Hamfest. A number of issues became evident during the May exercise which were discussed. Much of the discussion centered around congestion at the SEOC.
	</div><div class="para">
		With this backdrop, this paper introduces some thoughts for the 2011 SET and how we might use it to test some alternative methods for interfacing with the SEOC.
	</div></div><div xml:lang="en-US" class="section" title="2. Capabilities to be exercised" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="id3361391">2. Capabilities to be exercised</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
		Exercises should be designed to test specific capabilities. FEMA has provided a "Universal Task List", identifying the specific tasks reqiured for responding to all hazards. These tasks are grouped into five areas; an area for each of the emergency management missions, and a "Common Capabilities" area representing those capabilities needed across all missions: 
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul compact="compact"><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Common Capabilities
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Prevent
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Protect
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Respond
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					Recover
				</div></li></ul></div>

	</div><div class="para">
		Each of these areas is further subdivided. As communications providers, much of our responsibility falls under the Common Capabilities area, and especially the subcategory, "Communications". However, most of the tasks within the Common Capabilities area apply to us, as do many of the tasks within the other mission areas, especially Respond. A complete list of the tasks witin the Common Capabilities area is included in the appendices to this paper
	</div><div class="para">
		Based on the deficiencies exposed in the May exercise, it would make sense to focus the next exercise on two tasks: 
		<div class="itemizedlist"><ul compact="compact"><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					ComA2.4.3.1 - Develop Standard Operating Procedures and Standard Operating Guides in support of Emergency Operations Plans
				</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
					ComC1.2.2 - Develop common communication and data standards to facilitate the exchange of information in support of response management
				</div></li></ul></div>

	</div><div class="para">
		Clearly, many of the taks within the Communications section are applicable to almost any action taken by ARES/RACES, but these two seem appropriate areas of focus for this upcoming exercise.
	</div><div class="para">
		For reference, the tasks within the "Common Capabilites" are listed in Appendix A. Appendix E lists all the Target Capabilities, along with the top level headings for the tasks within those capabilities. The entire Universal Task List encompasses thousands of tasks.
	</div></div><div xml:lang="en-US" class="section" title="3. Issues to address" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="id3128858">3. Issues to address</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
		A number of issues have arisen in past exercises that should be addressed. Not all will or should be addressed in a single exercise, however, some of the key issues should be touched, and are enumerated below.
	</div><div class="section" title="3.1. SEOC as Net Control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3271436">3.1. SEOC as Net Control</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			On some occasions, the SEOC has atrempted to act as a net control station. While at times this has worked, at other times, especially when there is a lot of traffic or when the SEOC becomes particularly busy, this has not worked well. Indeed, most counties have found that it is better to run SKYWARN net control from an isolated location, so NCS may focus on the net, and be isolated to a degree from operational distractions. During some SEOC activations, the level of distraction at the station, even though it is isolated from the SEOC proper, can be substantial.
		</div><div class="para">
			Given the large number of stations that are active when the SEOC station is active, it may not even make sense for the SEOC station to join a net, let alone serve as NCS.
		</div></div><div class="section" title="3.2. Interface between ARES and NTS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3127734">3.2. Interface between ARES and NTS</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			In recent exercises the Section has attempted to route most taffic through NTS. This leads to a large number of advantages, and has worked well. However, improvements are still possible. A few of the shortcomings noted: 
			<div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						NTS operators do not always know what frequency to report to or when
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						ARES operators are unaware of nets or their capabilities
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						ARES operators are unfamiliar with NTS procedures
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						ARES operators are unfamiliar with directed nets
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						NTS operators are unfamiliar with ARES procedures and organization
					</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
						NTS leadership does not take ownership of emergency operations
					</div></li></ul></div>

		</div></div></div><div xml:lang="en-US" class="section" title="4. Possible Approaches" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="id3138383">4. Possible Approaches</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
		If one steps back and looks at what we are attempting, it seems we largely have the capabilities in place, but have failed to exploit them. It would seem that falling back to "standard" operational procedures, and adding some permanance to the relationships may help significantly.
	</div><div class="section" title="4.1. ARES-NTS Relationships"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3292983">4.1. ARES-NTS Relationships</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			For this exercise, it is proposed that we implement what we hope to become a more or less permanant relationship between the Affiliated Section Nets and the ARES Districts. Each District will be assigned a net, and each net a District, with the expectation that this relationship will remain past the exercise, extending not only to future Section-wide exercises, but quite possibly also to District and local exercises where it becomes appropriate.
		</div><div class="para">
			It is expected that each Net Manager will develop a relationship with a District Emergency Coordinator. In this way each can develop an understanding of the skills, capabilities and needs of the other. We have moved in this direction in earlier exercises, but never with the intention that the relationship be more or less permanent. The nets do not neatly overlay the Districts, so the relationship isn't always obvious.
		</div><div class="para">
			Key criteria for matching the District with the net should include such considerations as the net's coverage, distribution of membership, and proximity of the Net Manager to the District Emergency Coordinator.
		</div></div><div class="section" title="4.2. Liaison to the SEOC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3231426">4.2. Liaison to the SEOC</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			It has long been the practice of traffic nets to collect traffic on a net, then send a liaison to another outlet to forward the traffic. Rather than encourage congestion on the SEOC operating frequencies, it only makes sense for the nets to each send a liaison to SEOC to bring traffic to/from the SEOC station.
		</div><div class="para">
			Since the SEOC can operate two frequencies simultaneously, and the nets need only one member to act as liaison to the SEOC, rather than 83 stations all trying to contact the SEOC on a single frequency, there would be only four stations on each of two frequencies. This would imply that some phone nets would contact the SEOC on CW, but all of the HF nets (at least) have some CW capable members. 
			<div class="figure" id="id3209830"><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/SET11-NTS.png" width="534.6" alt="Traffic Flow" /><div class="longdesc"><div class="para">
							Traffic Flow
						</div></div></div></div><h6>Figure 1. Traffic Flow</h6></div><br class="figure-break" />
			 The above figure outlines the proposal for alignment between Districts and nets. Black lines indicate liaison with SEOC on 3.563 MHz, while violet lines indicate contact on 3.932 MHz.
		</div></div><div class="section" title="4.3. Net ownership of response duties"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3327097">4.3. Net ownership of response duties</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			In previous exercises, nets were often micromanaged by the STM, specifying meeting times, frequencies, etc. This worked better than giving vague instructions to the net manager with the expectation that they would "deal with it", but in the event of an actual incident, is quite unrealstic.
		</div><div class="para">
			If they are to be at all useful in an actual event, the nets must understand their responsibilities, and net managers must develop strategies for activating their net at unusual times and/or frequencies. By assigning Districts to nets more or less permanently, the nets have a better defined scope, and a "customer" with whom they may develop a relationship.
		</div><div class="para">
			For the coming SET (and hopefully future exercises and incidents), it is expected that each Net Manager will contact the corresponding District Emergency Coordinator and arrange net schedules, frequencies, net controls and liaisons. Note that all nets should expect to send a liaison to the SEOC early in the event, but other times need to be worked out between the net and the District.
		</div><div class="para">
			Since exercises typically last only a few hours, a net may choose to meet for the duration of the event, or may elect to schedule specific times of contact so that the counties have targeted times for which to prepare traffic. While most nets may choose to meet on their normal frequencies, note that the SEOC will be occupying the GLETN and QMN frequencies, which happen to be the Michigan phone and CW emergency frequencies, so these nets will need to select alternate frequences.
		</div></div><div class="section" title="4.4. &quot;Outlier&quot; nets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="id3275570">4.4. "Outlier" nets</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			There are a few affiliated nets which have unusual duties or are omitted. There are seven districts and four NWS offices. The NWS offices do not offer the complexity of a District; i.e. they have no further subdivisions. There are some nets that share a Net Manager. Not every District has a Net Manager residing in that District. This inevitably leads to a certain amount of unevenness in how the nets are treated. The strategy shown above attempts to minimize that unevenness.
		</div><div class="para">
			MITN and SEMTN share a Net Manager. That Net Manager happens to reside in a district not fully covered by SEMTN, but adjacent. That Net Manager has double work for this exercise.
		</div><div class="para">
			TMMTN is in District 3, but covers only a small fraction of that District. The Net Manager for TMMTN is also the Net Manager for GLETN. In addition, GLETN has some special challenges, so rather than assign that Net Manager double duty, TMMTN was left out of the plan.
		</div><div class="para">
			GLETN has the widest coverage of all the nets, so that net was assigned the 4 NWS offices which represent the most geographically disparate group. There is considerable unevenness in the NWS offices, so even though this assignment represents the smallest group of contacts, it presents some special challenges.
		</div><div class="para">
			NLEUP is without a Net Manager and appears to have been more or less dormant for some time. NLEUP has thus been left out also.
		</div><div class="para">
			QMN has an assignment that is outside the District where the Net Manager resides, similarly for MACS. However, both of these Net Managers reside within repeater range of their served Districts and both nets include membership from these Districts.
