1.Â Notifying the SEC
---------------------


1.1.Â Statewide Events

For statewide events, the SEC is notified by the Michigan State Police
via E-Team notification when the SEOC is fully activated, or a need for
amateur radio is perceived. The SEC also monitors E-Team to be alert to
incidents which may deteriorate to the point that SEC attention is
required.


1.2.Â Local/Regional events

For local or regional events, the affected EC should notify the SEC by
cell phone (989-430-4855) or E-Team notification. For events of lower
urgency the EC may prefer email. When the EC is under significant
pressure (as is often the case in the event of an activation), the EC may
delegate notification to the DEC.


1.3.Â SEOC Station Activation

When the SEOC is fully activated, the Michigan State Police notifies the
station manager by pager. For other events, the SEC may notify the
station manager by telephone as required.


1.4.Â SEC Staff Notification

As required, the SEC may notify the Assistant SECs by telephone.


2.Â Notifying the Districts
---------------------------

The SEC will notify the DECs by E-Team notification. If time permits,
those DECs who cannot be reached via E-Team will be notified by
telephone. The E-Team notification list is as follows:

  *  District 1 - Daniel Sprow

  *  District 2 - John Fleming

  *  District 3 - Stan Darmofal

  *  District 5 - Art Snapper

  *  District 6 - Jeffrey Nawrot

  *  District 7 - Thomas Duggan

  *  District 8 - Lou Gembolis

In addition, all the ASECs are included in that notification. DECs are
strongly encouraged to join E-Team themselves, and ensure at least one
assistant DEC also is qualified for E-Team. Less than half of the DECs
currently are qualified for E-Team.


2.1.Â National Weather Service Offices

Currently, none of the NWS DECs have E-Team capability. As a consequence,
NWS DECs will be notified by telephone as appropriate.


2.2.Â Regional and Local Incidents

In the case of a regional or local event where the SEC becomes involved
before the DEC, the SEC will typically notify the affected DEC by
telephone. Depending on the incident, nearby DECs may also be notified.
