ChapterÂ 1.Â General Responsibilities
-------------------------------------

1.1. Team Objectives

1.2. Resource Needs


1.1.Â Team Objectives
---------------------

ARES/RACES is present at the SEOC to provide backup communications
between the area of an incident or emergency and the various state
agencies. The "agency coordinator" (SEC or alternate) sits in on the EOC
proceedings and stays alert to communications needs of the other
agencies. The station staff operates the radio station at the direction
of the coordinator, but, depending on the incident status, may need to
provide status information and/or direction to the coordinator. Because
emergencies are by nature unpredictable, the specific actions taken by
all team members must necessarily react to the incident. Leadership and
creativity are required at all levels, and each participant must be
willing to help the others as the need arises. In order to meet the
communications needs of the incident, resources are required at the SEOC
station as well as in the field. The station manager is responsible for
recruiting operators for the SEOC station and marshalling those operators
as needed. The Emergency Coordinator in the affected area is primarily
responsible for local resources. However, should the capabilities of the
local county be exceeded, the SEC or alternate must marshall additional
resources, typically by contacting the DEC of the affected area, adjacent
DECs or in some cases, nearby ECs directly.


1.2.Â Resource Needs
--------------------

The SEC or alternate is the top ranking ARES official for the incident.
As a consequence, it falls to him to ensure that the event is adequately
staffed. Depending on the needs of the particular incident, this will
require contacting other individuals around the state, and perhaps
applying some persuasion to achieve the desired result. Most commonly,
the SEC will contact the DEC for the area affected by the incident. The
DEC is aware of the resources of the affected county and the surrounding
counties. If the EC can be reached, he is typically the most able to
respond quickly. However, when an incident is underway, the EC can often
be difficult to reach. At times the local DEC is unreachable or has
exhausted all resources. The SEC must then exploit the resources of other
Districts. Nearby Districts are obviously preferred due to travel times,
but any District may have the needed resources and must be considered.


ChapterÂ 2.Â Specific Duties
----------------------------

2.1. Checking In

2.2. Liaison with the station

2.3. Agency Announcements

2.4. Debrief


2.1.Â Checking In
-----------------

On arrival, sign in at the front door. The door to the downstairs
stairway will be locked. If the rep or alternate does not have a pass
card, an officer will escort him to the security station. The rep must
pick up a badge at the security station outside the EOC room. Because of
ovecrowding at the SEOC, RACES often does not have a designated position.
Select a position that is available.


2.2.Â Liaison with the station
------------------------------

The rep's primary function is to provide a communications path between
the station status and the various agencies.

  *  Apprise the various agencies of the current station status if needed

  *  Communicate the current status of the field situation, as understood
    by the SEOC, to the station.

  *  Alert the station of any communications needs of the agencies.

If possible, spend some time with the operators prior to the exercise to
understand the situation there. Ideally, the rep will have an HT and will
agree with the station on an available frequency. Note that the station's
VHF radio will likely be in use, so communication between the rep and the
station will probably be HT to HT. If HTs are not available or do not
work, the telephone may be used. Keep in mind, however, that the SEOC rep
will likely not have the same number as in previous drills. Be sure the
station has the number. Stay in regular touch with the station; be aware
of their situation and whether they are in contact with the site. Keep
them up to date as to site changes as announced in the SEOC.


2.3.Â Agency Announcements
--------------------------

Periodically, the IC or Ops Section Chief will ask for agency updates.
Give a brief status of the station for each update. Keep in mind that the
agency reps are non-technical, but most realize that we are their backup
plan. Give a meaningful status without getting technical. Pay at least
passing attention to the other agency reports. Should they need us our
job will be eased if we at least have some familiarity with their
situation. Consider updating the station with any interesting items from
the other agencies. Depending on the drill and players, there may be EOCs
on the converse bridge unaware of the situation at the site and in need
of update.


2.4.Â Debrief
-------------

At the end of the exercise, there will be a debrief from all agencies.
Prior to this check with the station operators to be sure you are aware
of any contact with the site or nearby jurisdictions. Make a positive,
brief presentation when asked. As usual, avoid technical details and
focus on capability.


ChapterÂ 3.Â E-Team
-------------------

3.1. Introduction

3.2. Logging On

3.3. Initial Duties

3.4. Repetitive Duties


3.1.Â Introduction
------------------

As a general rule, the station staff maintains the RACES Situation Report
(SitRep) since the SEC frequently does not have a terminal. However, if
for some reason the station staff is unable to maintain the SitRep, it
falls on the SEC or his delegate to do so. It is important to many
agencies to be alert to the state of readiness of the RACES station.
Agencies have discovered that their communications circuits are sometimes
fragile, and they may require our services. An up to date and accurate
SitRep gives them some confidence about our status. In any case, be sure
the Agency SitRep is complete, accurate, and up to date.


3.2.Â Logging On
----------------

  *  Log on to E-Team using the password provided by the DIT rep
    (typically Rich Law or Jacqueline Barcroft). They will usually log
    you on.


    Use SEOC-specific password
    --------------------------

    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Do not use your
    personal password when logging on at Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  the SEOC.


3.3.Â Initial Duties
--------------------

  *  Review the incident report

  *  Add an Agency SitRep


3.4.Â Repetitive Duties
-----------------------

  *  Update the agency sitrep approximately hourly (generally the station
    operators manage this).

  *  Add Duty Log entries if needed

  *  Review the incident report and other agency SitReps
