			ARES/RACES is present at the SEOC to provide backup communications between the area of an incident or emergency and the various state agencies. The "agency coordinator" (SEC or alternate) sits in on the EOC proceedings and stays alert to communications needs of the other agencies. The station staff operates the radio station at the direction of the coordinator, but, depending on the incident status, may need to provide status information and/or direction to the coordinator.

			Because emergencies are by nature unpredictable, the specific actions taken by all team members must necessarily react to the incident. Leadership and creativity are required at all levels, and each participant must be willing to help the others as the need arises.
		</div><div class="para">
			In order to meet the communications needs of the incident, resources are required at the SEOC station as well as in the field. The station manager is responsible for recruiting operators for the SEOC station and marshalling those operators as needed. The Emergency Coordinator in the affected area is primarily responsible for local resources. However, should the capabilities of the local county be exceeded, the SEC or alternate must marshall additional resources, typically by contacting the DEC of the affected area, adjacent DECs or in some cases, nearby ECs directly.
