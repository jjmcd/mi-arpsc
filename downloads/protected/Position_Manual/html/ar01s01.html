			ARES/RACES is present at the SEOC to provide backup communications between the area of an incident or emergency and the various state agencies. The "agency coordinator" (SEC or alternate) sits in on the EOC proceedings and stays alert to communications needs of the other agencies. The station staff operates the radio station at the direction of the coordinator, but, depending on the incident status, may need to provide status information and/or direction to the coordinator.
		</div><div class="para">
			Because emergencies are by nature unpredictable, the specific actions taken by all team members must necessarily react to the incident. Leadership and creativity are required at all levels, and each participant must be willing to help the others as the need arises.
		</div><div class="para">
			In order to meet the communications needs of the incident, resources are required at the SEOC station as well as in the field. The station manager is responsible for recruiting operators for the SEOC station and marshalling those operators as needed. The Emergency Coordinator in the affected area is primarily responsible for local resources. However, should the capabilities of the local county be exceeded, the SEC or alternate must marshall additional resources, typically by contacting the DEC of the affected area, adjacent DECs or in some cases, nearby ECs directly.

			The SEC or alternate is the top ranking ARES official for the incident. As a consequence, it falls to him to ensure that the event is adequately staffed. Depending on the needs of the particular incident, this will require contacting other individuals around the state, and perhaps applying some persuasion to achieve the desired result.
		</div><div class="para">
			Most commonly, the SEC will contact the DEC for the area affected by the incident. The DEC is aware of the resources of the affected county and the surrounding counties. If the EC can be reached, he is typically the most able to respond quickly. However, when an incident is underway, the EC can often be difficult to reach.
		</div><div class="para">
			At times the local DEC is unreachable or has exhausted all resources. The SEC must then exploit the resources of other Districts. Nearby Districts are obviously preferred due to travel times, but any District may have the needed resources and must be considered.
