			On arrival, sign in at the front door. The door to the downstairs stairway will be locked. If the rep or alternate does not have a pass card, an officer will escort him to the security station.

			The rep must pick up a badge at the security station outside the EOC room. Because of ovecrowding at the SEOC, RACES often does not have a designated position. Select a position that is available.

			 If possible, spend some time with the operators prior to the exercise to understand the situation there.
		</div><div class="para">
			Ideally, the rep will have an HT and will agree with the station on an available frequency. Note that the station's VHF radio will likely be in use, so communication between the rep and the station will probably be HT to HT.
		</div><div class="para">
			If HTs are not available or do not work, the telephone may be used. Keep in mind, however, that the SEOC rep will likely not have the same number as in previous drills. Be sure the station has the number.
		</div><div class="para">
			Stay in regular touch with the station; be aware of their situation and whether they are in contact with the site. Keep them up to date as to site changes as announced in the SEOC.

			Periodically, the IC or Ops Section Chief will ask for agency updates. Give a brief status of the station for each update. Keep in mind that the agency reps are non-technical, but most realize that we are their backup plan. Give a meaningful status without getting technical.
		</div><div class="para">
			Pay at least passing attention to the other agency reports. Should they need us our job will be eased if we at least have some familiarity with their situation.
		</div><div class="para">
			Consider updating the station with any interesting items from the other agencies. Depending on the drill and players, there may be EOCs on the converse bridge unaware of the situation at the site and in need of update.

			At the end of the exercise, there will be a debrief from all agencies. Prior to this check with the station operators to be sure you are aware of any contact with the site or nearby jurisdictions.
		</div><div class="para">
			Make a positive, brief presentation when asked. As usual, avoid technical details and focus on capability.
