			Ideally, the rep will have an HT and will agree with the station on an available frequency. Note that the station's VHF radio will likely be in use, so communication between the rep and the station will probably be HT to HT.
		</div><div class="para">
			If HTs are not available or do not work, the telephone may be used. Keep in mind, however, that the SEOC rep will likely not have the same number as in previous drills. Be sure the station has the number.
		</div><div class="para">
			Stay in regular touch with the station; be aware of their situation and whether they are in contact with the site. Keep them up to date as to site changes as announced in the SEOC.
