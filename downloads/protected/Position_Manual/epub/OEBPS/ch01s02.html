			The SEC or alternate is the top ranking ARES official for the incident. As a consequence, it falls to him to ensure that the event is adequately staffed. Depending on the needs of the particular incident, this will require contacting other individuals around the state, and perhaps applying some persuasion to achieve the desired result.

			Most commonly, the SEC will contact the DEC for the area affected by the incident. The DEC is aware of the resources of the affected county and the surrounding counties. If the EC can be reached, he is typically the most able to respond quickly. However, when an incident is underway, the EC can often be difficult to reach.
