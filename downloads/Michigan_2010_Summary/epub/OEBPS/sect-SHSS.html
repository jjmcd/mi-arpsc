		Because many of these documents contain sensitive information, the SEC has developed a "library" on the website where these documents can be easily found and, if necessary, password protected. DECs and Net Managers have been given password access, and it is anticipated that most ECs will also require access. Each program within the Section has a dedicated area within the library.
