		Michigan's National Traffic System consists of amateurs who send messages (called "traffic") around the Section and around the nation. These amateurs are organized into a group of on the air nets that meet frequently with the intent of passing messages. These are the "unsung heros" of ARPSC; many practice their skill every day, but they operate behind the scene, out of the eye of the served agencies and the public.
	</div><div class="para">
		The individual nets report monthly. Michigan nets send approximately 1000 messages a month. In 2010, they reported 13,848 messages passed. Not all traffic is reported, although the large number of non-reporting nets probably pass a small fraction of the messages. The chart below shows the performance across the year:

		 Detailed reports for the most recent month are available at <a href="http://www.mi-nts.org/netreport.php">http://www.mi-nts.org/netreport.php</a>. Links on the page allow for viewing of previous reports or individual net history.
	</div><div class="para">
		Michigan amateurs also participate in other nets. The Eighth Region net takes messages destined for out of state addresses, and collects traffic bound for Michigan to pass to Michigan representatives who will then carry those messages to the Michigan nets. The Eastern Area Net interfaces with the Region nets to move traffic among the Regions in the Eastern Area. The Transcontinental Corps arranges to move traffic between the Areas. Michigan amateurs participate in all of these, however that effort is not reflected in Michigan reporting.
