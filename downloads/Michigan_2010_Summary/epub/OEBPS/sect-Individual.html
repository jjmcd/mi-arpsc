		In addition to reporting by Emergency Coordinators and Net Managers, individual amateurs are also encouraged to make reports. There are three reports from individuals; Public Service Honor Roll, Station Activity Report, and Brass Pounder's League.
	</div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="id2906470">4.1. Public Service Honor Roll</h2></div></div></div><div class="para">
			The Public Service Honor Roll reporting combines activity in a number of categories. Stations get "points" for net checkins, traffic, Section level appointments, public service oriented web or other digital systems, and hours spent in public or emergency service.
		</div><div class="para">
			If a station reports 70 points within a month, that station is listed in QST, the amateur radio journal. If a station is listed for 12 consecutive months, or for 18 months out of 24, the League will issue a certificate.
		</div><div class="para">
			PSHR reporting for 2010 has been relatively flat across the year. The summer months tend to be higher due to bad weather and various public service events.

			Stations handling traffic are encouraged to submit Station Activity Reports (SAR) indicating the amount of traffic handled. Only 31 stations reported during 2010.
		</div><div class="para">
			Since most of the traffic is handled by relatively few stations, and those stations tend to be the stations that report, the traffic totals reported are quite high. Stations handling a lot of traffic tend to be those stations that act as liaisons to Region or Area nets, so even though the number of stations reporting is quite small, the amount of traffic reported is considerably larger than the totals from net reports, which include only messages passed on Michigan nets. For 2010, Michigan stations individually reported 35,423 messages.
