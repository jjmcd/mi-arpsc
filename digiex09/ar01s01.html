			At the fall EC meeting the possibility of holding a number of smaller exercises during the year focused on specific capabilities was discussed. It was suggested that exercises designed to exploit specific situations, modes or circuits could be educational.
		</div><div class="para">
			Dave, W8RIT, was tasked with designing an exercise we could have quickly, preferably during the first quarter, to examine digital modes.
		</div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="d0e91">1.2. Understanding the capability</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			A primary goal of such a test would be to get an understanding of the effectiveness of the various digital modes for use in emergency communications situations across the state.
		</div><div class="para">
			The potential for using digital modes has been raised many times. However, little quantitative data is available to help choose between the many modes available, nor do we really know whether they could be effective across a large number of stations with varying capability.
		</div></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="d0e98">1.3. Gaining familiarity</h3></div></div></div><div class="para">
			Such an exercise would also expose more members to these modes. Many amateurs have explored none of the sound card modes, in spite of the fact that they are easily and cheaply set up. Such an exercise should raise awareness of the modes and perhaps motivate some members to develop the capability.

			During this exercise we will test the capability, but one criticism of the “keyboard” modes has been that net procedures are not well worked out for these modes. The conduct of this exercise will not give us insight into that specific issue.
