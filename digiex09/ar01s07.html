			Use 20 watts PEP. Be very careful of your microphone gain. Excessive gain will distort your signal. Do not adjust your RF power at any point through your transmissions. Keep it at one position from the start of the test to the end.
		</div><div class="para">
			Remember that some modes have a higher transmit duty cycle. RTTY is 100% duty cycle and PSK31 is 80% duty cycle. Therefore, it can be easy to damage your transmitter with these duty cycles. Many modes will provide good communications with 5 to 30 W

			Please use one antenna only throughout the test. Do not switch an antenna in the middle of a test. Use an omni-directional antenna (or one close to omni) if at all possible. If you use a directional antenna it may alter reception strength at stations located in different geographic areas. Use an omni to "level the playing field" and to not introduce any other factors.

			Turn off your Windows Sounds. If you do not, you may transmit your Windows "ding" and we will hear that affecting your transmission as well. You do this from your Sounds and Audio Devices Properties window &gt; Sounds tab and under the dropdown menu for "Sound scheme" choose "No Sounds".
		</div><div class="para">
			Remember NOT to overdrive your soundcard. Doing so will in many cases cause splatter and unwanted sideband emissions. It may also warrant you an OO card. Follow the directions in the help for the software program. You may need to adjust your microphone gain for the soundcard and/or the radio.
		</div><div class="para">
			Do not have your radio's compressor turned on.
		</div><div class="para">
			If your radio has a notch filter you should understand its effect. Since the single sideband passband represents the entire "band" for some modes, a strong station can affect your AGC making copying difficult. Your notch filter may help you here. However, on some radios, the notch filter may distort the signal sufficiently that it cannot be decoded. Be especially careful of radios with older DSPs. In general, an audio DSP should be turned off, although IF DSP can be useful. <span class="emphasis"><em>Be familiar with your equipment</em></span>.

			Do not forget to send your callsign at the end of each transmission for obvious reasons.

			Center frequency- We will use the term center frequency. For our purposes, the definitions will be the center of the transmitted signal. Various soundcard modes have different bandwidths. For example, you may know that PSK31 has a bandwidth of 31 Hz (actually, 31.25Hz). MT-63 has various bandwidths from 500 Hz to 2 kHz. When we specify the center freq is 3583.75 kHz, that would mean that for MT-63 500Hz, the occupied bandwidth as seen on your waterfall would be from 3583.50 kHz to 3584.0 kHz.
		</div><div class="para">
			AFC- Use your AFC cautiously. In many of the modes you may want to turn on your AFC from the software to help properly track a transmitted signal, once the transmission has begun. Please ensure that you can place your trace in the waterfall, back at the original position, so that you do not miss characters at the start of the next transmission. If there is another close adjacent signal, it may track off and lock on to that unwanted signal. You may lose some time and a portion of the beginning of the desired signal for it to track back to it's proper spot in the waterfall. When the AFC tracking wanders like this it has the undesired action of missing characters in the beginning of the transmission. Don't let the AFC wander with your waterfall trace. The AFC of which I'm speaking is found in the software you choose, and may not be available depending on the mode. It may be best to turn the AFC off and be prepared shortly after receiving the other station to turn it on so it will properly follow that particular station's signal.
		</div><div class="para">
			Ripple in the passband of your receiver can cause reception issues. You should adjust receive levels so that you see some background "noise" on the waterfall (usually blue). If there are dark regions, you may have unnecessary filters turned on or there may be DSP artifacts. You may wish to tune your receiver so that the desired center frequency is away from these dark areas. You may also wish to test your filter and DSP settings to understand what control you have over this effect.
		</div><div class="para">
			Keep in mind that when receiving (or in many cases transmitting), there can be a small (or maybe not so small) latency delay between when you hear and see a station on your waterfall transmitting and the time it takes for you to start decoding text. This will vary from modes and their independent settings like: interleave, bandwidth, or other characteristic.
