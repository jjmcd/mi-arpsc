			Center frequency- We will use the term center frequency. For our purposes, the definitions will be the center of the transmitted signal. Various soundcard modes have different bandwidths. For example, you may know that PSK31 has a bandwidth of 31 Hz (actually, 31.25Hz). MT-63 has various bandwidths from 500 Hz to 2 kHz. When we specify the center freq is 3583.75 kHz, that would mean that for MT-63 500Hz, the occupied bandwidth as seen on your waterfall would be from 3583.50 kHz to 3584.0 kHz.

			AFC- Use your AFC cautiously. In many of the modes you may want to turn on your AFC from the software to help properly track a transmitted signal, once the transmission has begun. Please ensure that you can place your trace in the waterfall, back at the original position, so that you do not miss characters at the start of the next transmission. If there is another close adjacent signal, it may track off and lock on to that unwanted signal. You may lose some time and a portion of the beginning of the desired signal for it to track back to it's proper spot in the waterfall. When the AFC tracking wanders like this it has the undesired action of missing characters in the beginning of the transmission. Don't let the AFC wander with your waterfall trace. The AFC of which I'm speaking is found in the software you choose, and may not be available depending on the mode. It may be best to turn the AFC off and be prepared shortly after receiving the other station to turn it on so it will properly follow that particular station's signal.

			Ripple in the passband of your receiver can cause reception issues. You should adjust receive levels so that you see some background "noise" on the waterfall (usually blue). If there are dark regions, you may have unnecessary filters turned on or there may be DSP artifacts. You may wish to tune your receiver so that the desired center frequency is away from these dark areas. You may also wish to test your filter and DSP settings to understand what control you have over this effect.

			Keep in mind that when receiving (or in many cases transmitting), there can be a small (or maybe not so small) latency delay between when you hear and see a station on your waterfall transmitting and the time it takes for you to start decoding text. This will vary from modes and their independent settings like: interleave, bandwidth, or other characteristic.
